<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! My Name is Wendy Ayala. <br/> 
  I'm 30 years old and always had an interest in computers/technology ever since I was little.
  If I say so myself, MySpace was the beginning of coding for me. I loved that I could customize my profile and learn what each HTML & CSS code meant. 
  I am now at a point in my life where I need to find my purpose and a skill that will get me to reach that purpose/dreams.
  Being a great Software Developer will get me to achieve that. 
</p>

<p>
  My Purpose in life is to help people in need. I'm not sure exactly who, what, when and where but I do know that it is my life journey to be that light in people's lives who need it the most. 
  Now as far as my dreams, I would like to travel the world with my kids, fiance, my mom and siblings. 
  Most importantly, I want my kids to see the world and learn other cultures. We will all learn together and go on beautiful adventures all while helping people in need.
</p>

<p>Now, that I am 30 years old, I feel wiser and the need to get the ball rolling. 
  I'm a creative person but also like to be challenged to think of solutions.
  Software Developing is perfect for me as a career since it is a career where you are creative, challenged and come up with solutions. 
  I want to work alongside other brilliant people, work on creative and amazing projects plus have the financial freedom and flexibility to enjoy my family plus travel.
  This is going to push me into the greatness I know I have within me and the capability to achieve my goals and dreams. <br/>
  
  Anything is possible if you put your mind to it.
